## Why this blog?

**Never said better**. As you guys imagine from the title of this blog, I have quite an awful memory. Many pieces of information given to me, are at great risk of being forgotten :sob:.

I feel many of us tech guys have stumbled upon strange issues which have taken ages for us to solve. It would be a shame if we forgot how to solve them when we need it again after a while. It has happened to me before :man_facepalming: [^1].

It is only logical, and about time, that I create some sort of safe/vault to store those pearls of wisdom so I won't forget. Now I must concentrate on not forgetting about this blog.


## Who is this blog for?

:point_right: Do you forget stuff and need a tech/programming cheatsheet? This blog might be useful.
